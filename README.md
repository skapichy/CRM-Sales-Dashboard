## Dashboard Breakdown & Analysis

### 1. Sales Performance Overview

The KPI cards at the top of the dashboard summarize business health at a glance. The embedded trend lines help stakeholders quickly assess performance movement over time without navigating deeper visuals.

**Insight:**
Sales activity is strong, with a healthy volume of transactions relative to the number of accounts and agents, indicating good sales coverage and engagement.

---

### 2. Sales by Managers

This visual compares total sales value generated by each sales manager.

**Insight:**

* A small number of managers are responsible for a disproportionately high share of total revenue.
* This highlights strong leadership or more experienced teams under certain managers.

**Recommendation:**

* Replicate best practices from top-performing managers across other teams.
* Investigate resource allocation to ensure balanced opportunity distribution.

### 3. Sales by Sectors

This chart breaks down revenue contribution by industry sector.

**Insight:**

* Retail and technology-related sectors lead in revenue contribution.
* Lower-performing sectors may represent untapped growth opportunities or low product-market fit.

**Recommendation:**

* Increase sales and marketing focus on high-performing sectors.
* Reassess value propositions or pricing strategies for weaker sectors.

### 4. Top & Bottom Accounts by Sales

The dashboard highlights both the **Top 5** and **Bottom 5** accounts.

**Insight:**

* Revenue is concentrated among a small set of key accounts.
* Bottom-performing accounts contribute minimal revenue and may require attention.

**Recommendation:**

* Strengthen relationships with top accounts through retention and upsell strategies.
* Review bottom accounts for churn risk, reactivation opportunities, or possible de-prioritization.

---

### 5. Sales Agents Performance

This section compares **Top 5** and **Bottom 5** selling agents.

**Insight:**

* There is a noticeable performance gap between top and bottom agents.
* Top agents significantly outperform peers, indicating skill or territory differences.

**Recommendation:**

* Use top agents as benchmarks for training and mentorship.
* Provide targeted coaching and performance support to underperforming agents.

---

### 6. Sales by Products

This chart shows how different products contribute to total sales value.

**Insight:**

* One or two products dominate total sales revenue.
* Several products generate minimal sales impact.

**Recommendation:**

* Reevaluate low-performing products for repositioning or discontinuation.

### 7. Sales by Quarters

Quarterly analysis highlights revenue distribution across the year.

**Insight:**

* Q2 and Q3 show peak performance, while Q1 lags behind.
* This indicates potential seasonality in sales activity.

**Recommendation:**

* Plan campaigns and inventory ahead of high-performing quarters.
* Introduce targeted promotions to boost early-year sales.

### 8. Sales by Deal Stage

The donut chart visualizes deal distribution across stages (Won, Lost, Engaging).

**Insight:**

* A significant portion of deals are still lost, signaling room for optimization.

**Recommendation:**

* Analyze lost deals to identify pricing, product, or process gaps.
* Strengthen sales enablement materials to improve conversion at critical stages.
